Project Summary:

Programming Language: Java
Tools Used: 
	• Eclipse Neon 3, Java JDK 8
	• Findbugs – 3.0.1
	• SonarLint – 3.3.1

<Code> folder contains the codes used.
<Report> folder contains the report submitted including the FindBugs analysis reports for both part-1, part-2 codes.

The goal of this assignment is to use open source static code analysis tools to find bugs and vulnerabilities in source code and to recognize that not all tools are created equal. Each tool uses different analysis techniques and is programmed with different rules for detection of problems. Also, the settings, and in some cases the plugins, used in a tool will have an effect on what types of problems it can identify.
Part 1 (SimpleWebServer.java):
For the first part of this assignment, analyzed a simple web server written in Java (code provided by Professor). The analysis was performed with two tools, one is FindBugs v3.0.0 with the FindBugs Security Plugin v1.4.6. The second tool was SonarLint 2.1.
Part 2 (SimpleJavaClass.java):
For the second part of this assignment, picked a piece of code I have written in the past. Ran the static analysis tools on this code and fixed the bugs returned by the static analysis tools.

Finally, submitted a report explaining how I have configured the static analysis tools for both the java files used (Professor provided one, personal one). Also, submitted the results of the tools and code fixes for the issues reported by the tools in both part-1 code and part-2 code.
